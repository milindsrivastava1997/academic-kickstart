Hi, I'm Milind! I'm a 5th year Dual Degree student in the <a href="https://cse.iitm.ac.in">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I am a part of RISE lab and I'm advised by <a href="http://cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester">Prof. Chester Rebeiro.</a>

I am looking for PhD positions. I have primarily worked in microarchitectural and hardware security but my interests lie in computer systems security across the stack from hardware to OS to software and networks.
